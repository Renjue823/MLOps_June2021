# TODO: 
#### Things we would add to the project, but don't have time for right now 


##### 1. fetch_dataset.py file
This could be file where the dataset is automatically fecthed, f.eks. by using urrlib or stmth similar. This file should then be run as part of the setup after downloading. 


##### 2. Include a link to where to download the dataset manually 
Here it is just important to refer to the actual dataset that we used.


##### 3. Contiuous integreation (Laura)

##### 4. Profiling (Renjue)

##### 5. Tensorboard (Later)

##### 6. Azure (Freja + Anna)

##### 7. Pytorch lightning (Later Renjue)

##### 8. Data drifting (Anna)

##### 9. Hyperparameters (Laura + Freja)

##### 10. Reproducablity
